# NYU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Plan
---

## Project Description
---

For the webgame project I was inspired to make a card game. As I decided on what type of game it would be I decided that it could not be a game like MTG or Yu-gi-oh, because the complexity of responding to your opponent would be difficult to keep track and have responses to. In terms of digital card games I used games like Hearthstone/Shadowverse as a big inspiration. The basic 20 health counter comes from Shadowverse, but Hearthstone's 30 could also be used. The RPG Paper Mario's combat system also gave me inspiration that the numbers for health should be kept at a minimum to allow for further complexity if I get to it post-MVP. Instead of having a boardbased cardgame with creatures, monsters, or followers I wanted to simplify it with your own health total and varying attribute changes, I was inspired by the digital boardgame 100% Orange Juice. 


## Game Logic

The player is given an opening deck of cards and is given the first option to make a turn. The player has the option to use whatever cards are given through the hand. When the player makes a choice they will be able to see the effect of the card being played on in that instance.

The player will achieve victory when they drop the opponent's life total to zero. The player will be given a defeat if their life total drops to zero.

### MVP Criteria

- The game must be able to have a draw function to add cards to the hand
- The player must be able to see the effect of the card by hovering over it before they can actually play it.
- The life totals must be able to be interacted with using the effects of the cards
- The opponent must be able to have their own turn and play similar cards to the player
- The player must be able to end their turn with a button or clause

### Post-MVP Plans

Even for post-MVP I don't know if I want to implement anything like responses or field-changing effects.

Post-MVP I would also like to implement a rogue-like element, what I want to take from those games is having a positive addition being weighed against a negative.

- I would also also like to be able to determine what cards are played in response to how much health they have.
- Adding a dice to the game for certain effects and having it play out.
- Having the game understand when the player has no more moves prior to the turn ending
- Having the deck be randomized that way the draw is not the same throughout each playthrough
- Having multiple opponents instead of just the 1 with different behaviors.
